## template description (delete this section)
This is a template for creating new update pages. To use this template, copy the contents and paste it into a new markdown (.md) file. Fill in the front matter (between dashes) with the appropriate information and replace the content with the relevant information for the new page. Capitalisation indicate where information should be inserted.

This is a simpler template compared to the documentation template. A descriptive title should be used as this will be displayed in the latest updates section of the main page. The content section is where the main body of the page is written and is displayed on the main update pages. This can include text, images, code snippets, and more.
