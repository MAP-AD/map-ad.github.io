CONTENT GOES HERE

## template description (delete this section)
This is a template for creating new documentation pages for tool. To use this template, copy the contents and paste it into a new markdown (.md) file. Fill in the front matter (between dashes) with the appropriate information and replace the content with the relevant information for the new page. Capitalisation indicate where information should be inserted.

The front matter information is used throughout the site to fill in relevant information (e.g. tools table in the main page). The content section is where the main body of the page is written. This can include text, images, code snippets, and more.

images can be added to the page by placing them in the assets/img folder and linking them in the markdown file. For example, to add an image called 'example.png' in the assets/img folder, the following markdown syntax can be used:

`![example image](/assets/img/template/example.png)`
