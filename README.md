## About

This repository contains the source code for the MAP tools documentation website. The website aims to provide instiutional memory of the tools and scripts developed on the MAP project. It does not aim to replace documentation of the tools themselves, but to provide a central location/wiki for information about the tools/methods and their usage.

The website is built using Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages.
